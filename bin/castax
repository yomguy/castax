# $1 is the maximum velocity value desired at the input of the duct
# $2 is the frequency of the input sinusoid velocity
# $3 is the .geo file containing the 2D profile of the duct
# $4 is the directory path for backuping (/*.tgz + restit)
# $5 is the directory path for results (res/ is default)
# optional:
# $6 is the video exporting option (type "videos" to export)
